## About the Project

The application is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple way for gamers to keep track of their games.  
It features a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, and deleting games, as well as viewing game details and statistics.  
The application is built using **Nuxt** for the frontend, a Web API developed in **.NET 8**, and **MySQL** as the database.
