## About the Project

The application is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple way for gamers to keep track of their games.  
It features a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, and deleting games, as well as viewing game details and statistics.  
The application is built using **Nuxt** for the frontend, a Web API developed in **.NET 8**, and **MySQL** as the database.

### Backend

The Web API is **RESTful** and follows best practices for API design, making it easy to integrate with other applications and services.  
It also uses **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** principles to ensure that the code is well-organized and maintainable.

The API utilizes the following NuGet packages:
- **FluentValidation** for validating incoming requests
- **AutoMapper** for mapping between different object types
- **FluentAssertions** for writing unit tests
- **EntityFrameworkCore** for database access
