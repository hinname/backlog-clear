## About the project

The Web API is **RESTful** and follows best practices for API design, making it easy to integrate with other applications and services.  
It also uses **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** principles to ensure the code is well-organized and maintainable.

The API utilizes NuGet packages such as **FluentValidation** for validating incoming requests, **AutoMapper** for mapping between different object types, **FluentAssertions** for writing unit tests, and **EntityFrameworkCore** for database access.

#### Features

- **CRUD** operations for games
- **Domain-Driven Design** principles
- **Unit tests**: The API is tested using **xUnit** and **FluentAssertions** to ensure the code works as expected
- **Reports**: The API provides detailed reports in **PDF** and **Excel** formats, allowing users to easily share and analyze their game data
